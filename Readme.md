2. It can convert text to morse code
3. It is an interactive quiz on morse code
4. It has a beginner-friendly menu for easy usage
5. It can convert all the letters and numbers

## Technologies/ Tools used

1. Python 3– Language used to make the code
2. Python Module random- Used to get random alphabets and numbers for the quiz questions
3. Dictionaries– Used to remember the morse code for all numbers and the alphabets
4. Strings- Used to convert two forms (morse code and text) into one another
5. Loops and Conditional Statements– Used to navigate menu and get quiz answers from inputs

## Steps to install & run the project
