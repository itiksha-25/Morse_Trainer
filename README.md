# Morse Code Trainer
A simple interactive Python application to learn and practice Morse Code for all learners and enthusiasts.

## Overview
Morse Code Trainer is a simple Python-based application made to help users learn and practice Morse Code. 

It allows users to convert text to Morse Code, vice versa, and take quizzes to test their understanding. 

It is made with Python dictionary, for loops, and string manipulation, this tool is ideal for beginners, students, and enthusiasts who want to improve their Morse Code skills in a fun way using interactive quizzes and serves educational purposes.


## Features

1. Converts morse code to text
2. Converts text to morse code
3. Interactive quiz on morse code
4. Beginner-friendly menu for easy usage
5. Converts all the letters and numbers

## Technologies/ Tools used

1. **Python 3**– Core language used to make the code
2. **Python Module random**- Used to get random alphabets and numbers for the quiz questions
3. **Dictionaries**– Used to remember the morse code for all numbers and the alphabets
4. **Strings**- Used to convert two forms (morse code and text) into one another
5. **Loops and Conditional Statements**– Used to navigate menu and get quiz answers from inputs

## Steps to install & run the project

1. **Install Python 3**

   Ensure Python 3 is installed on your device.
2. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   
   Clone the project and navigate to its folder.

3. **Run the application**
  
   Run the app by pasting the following in the terminal:

````

python3 morse_code_app.py

`````


4. **Follow Instructions Displayed**
   
   A menu will appear on the terminal. Choose any option to start using the code and learning.


## Instructions for testing

1. **Run the app in Python:**

   Run the app by pasting the following in the terminal:

````

python3 morse_code_app.py

`````


2. **Test each feature from the menu in the terminal:**

   
````

a) Text to Morse – Give any text and cross-check the Morse Code from trusted place.

b) Morse to Text – Give correct morse code and check if output is right.

c) Quiz – Try some questions it gives in quiz to test knowledge and its correctness. Type QUIT to exit the quiz.

````

3. **Check input handling**
  
   Try wrong or no inputs.
4. **Check Program quit**

   Verify the app stop when quit and exit is used.
