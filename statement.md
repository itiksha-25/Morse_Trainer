Problem Statement
------------------

Learning morse code is very hard and we have to do the same things again and again to remember , so this app makes it easy and fun by letting users convert, decode, and practice with quizzes.

Many people want to learn morse code and enjoy talking in code language or maybe even write about their daily life in language that not everyone understands(or even to spy on someone doing that!), but tools available online are often very very complicated, require signing-up, or even steal sensitive personal data on their servers. 

This project addresses that very need for a simple, easy-to-run app that lets people record learn a new form of language, on their own device. 

The aim is to make morse code more accessible, especially for people who want privacy when they want to unburden their heart or keep their feelings to themselves or converse with someone without letting anyone else know what they are talking about.


Scope of Project
----------------
This application mainly focuses on learning morse code as a form of communiction. Users can use this to learn the code and talk privately with others or even keep their emotions and feelings to themselves whenever needed. The project is very practical and minimal; having only core Python coding.
